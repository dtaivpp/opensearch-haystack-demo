# OpenSearch Haystack Demo

Welcome to the OpenSearch Haystack Demo! Here we showcase how to use [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org) as a context store for language models such as [flan](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt). 

This demo uses a bot that integrates with Discord as the interface. There are many other ways this could be exposes such as with a rest api or integrated into your forums.
